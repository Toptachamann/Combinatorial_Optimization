Simple class for solving unweighted maximum cardinality matching problem. Has method for reading graph represented as
an edge list. First three integers in an input file are number of vertices in a first partite, number of vertices in a
second partite and number of edges. Has method for formulating this problem as a linear programme. Has a method 
for getting maximum cardinality matching (based on hungarian algorithm).
Matching tester class has a method for generating random bipartite graphs with given parameters and a method for 
comparing hungarian algorithm's and lp's performances.
